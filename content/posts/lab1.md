## 1. Definitions:
1. HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, a markup language which is a standard for creating web pages.
2. CSS - Cascading Style Sheets, a language used for creating layout and a presentation of web pages.
3. Javascript - a programming language that defines behaviour of web pages.
4. HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol, an application-layer protocol used for transferring data between web browsers and servers.
5. HTML5 - the current version of the Hypertext Markup Language.
6. Dynamic HTML (DHTML) - a term, describing a set of technologies for creating interactive web pages; it's a combination of HTML, CSS, JS and DOM (Document Object Model). <br>

## 2. Coding conventions:

I'm using conventions from http://codeguide.co/ while writing code.
From my point of view, coding conventions that improve code readability the most are naming, indentation, comment and line length.
While being relatively easy to pick up and implement, they make project collaboration much easier, because all developers in that case follow the same coding style and that consistency allows them to focus on the task at hand.  

## 3. HTML5

## 4. Developer tools

In Google Chrome the Developer Tools can be accessed using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I.
Also one can right-click on an empty space at a page and call Inspector from the context menu.
It contains many great tools useful for web development, like Inspector, Device Toolbar (lets you test how the interface looks on different devices' screens and in different orientation modes), Console to assist with debugging and Animations tab, which helps to control and fine-tune animations present on a webpage.


## 5. Dynamic HTML
